# Product image guidelines

For this redesign we now stream high-resolution assets directly from FakeStore API image URLs (see `src/data/products.js`). If you decide to replace them with self-hosted photography later, upload category-specific product shots (min 800x800) into the matching folder, use descriptive names like `appliances-lg-smart-fridge-01.jpg`, and keep at least 4-5 angles per product. Sourcing tip: Unsplash/Pexels allow commercial use.
